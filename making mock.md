# Creating New Mock

1. **Images**. Make a folder, where all questions are saved as individual screenshots (preferred format `.PNG`). The file name should be:
	- Major : `i.PNG` where `i` is the problem number
	- Hurry-Up : `xi.PNG` where `x` is topic - {m/e/x} and `i` is problem number

2. **Answers**. Create a file named `ans.txt`. Each line of the file should have answer to problem as it appears in the question paper. Put an `x` in a new line after end of a particular section. Answer format is:
	- Units - SI units if not mentioned in QP, else mentioned unit
	- No Scientific Form - Answer should be a decimal

3. **Points**. Create a file named `pts.txt`. Each line of the file should have the points the problem is worth as it appears in the question paper. Put an `x` in a new line after end of a particular section.

### Note
Do not add any extra characters (even spaces or `\n`s) in the `.txt` files as it will cause error.
For a sample, check the `pb2019` folder.

## What to do after the above steps
DM me @ `Delta0001#8468` on Discord with a zipped folder containing the `images` folder and the `.txt` files. I will add it to the published bot.
